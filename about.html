          This is my dog Cozmo. He was born on March 27th, 2010 and sadly passed
          away in April 22nd, 2022. I am dedicating this website to him.

            Hello! My name is Towe, and this is a website for my dog Cozmo.

            <p>
              I have created this website to hone my front-end developing
              skills. It's still a work in progress, as I am both learning and
              re-learning things at the same time. <br /><br />
              I currently have a full-time day job that takes up most of my time
              during the day, and when I come home after work, I am usually
              drained of energy. So, progress is taking a while, but I am slowly
              adding more and more things.<br /><br />
              I am currently adapting this website to mobile view, and later to
              tablet view as well. Future projects involve SVG canvas maps,
              forms, the usage of localstorage as well as more games.
